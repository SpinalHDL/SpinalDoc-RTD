#	Sphinx uses extension: sphinx.ext.imgconverter
#
#	This calls out to ImageMagicK convert.
#
#	The older docs tags we build have links to 3rd party websites (travis-ci) for SVG badges.
#	This returns HTTP/404 but the HTML response is kept and processed as if it returned HTTP/200. (bug in spinix?)
#	When 'convert' tries to convert foobar.svg (which is a .html format file error page) it has a parse error.
#	This terminates the document building process completely.
#
#	This script is a wrapper for convert, if it fails it logs and provides an empty file instead.
