ReadableOpenDrain
=================

The ReadableOpenDrain bundle is defined as following :

.. code-block:: scala

   case class ReadableOpenDrain[T<: Data](dataType : HardType[T]) extends Bundle with IMasterSlave {
     val write,read : T = dataType()

     override def asMaster(): Unit = {
       out(write)
       in(read)
     }
   }

Then, as a master, you can use the ``read`` signal to read the outside value and use the ``write`` to set the value that you want to drive on the output.

There is an example of usage :

.. code-block:: scala

   val io = new Bundle {
     val dataBus = master(ReadableOpenDrain(Bits(32 bits)))
   }

   io.dataBus.write := 0x12345678
   when(io.dataBus.read === 42) {

   }
