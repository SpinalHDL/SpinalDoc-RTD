Generator framework
===================

Deprecated (This framework is now replaced by the fiber one)

The generator framework allow to specify and run the hardware elaboration in a out of order manner, a bit similarly to Makefile, where you can define rules and dependencies which will then be solved when you run a make command. 

Such framework complexify simple things but provide some strong feature for complex cases :

- You can define things before even knowing all their requirements, ex : instantiating a interruption controller, before knowing how many lines of interrupt you need
- Abstract/lazy/partial SoC architecture definition allowing the creation of SoC template for further specializations
- Automatic requirements negotiation between multiple agents in a decentralized way, ex : between masters and slaves of a memory bus

The framework is mainly composed of : 

- Generator, which will run its tasks as soon all its dependencies are loaded.
- Handle[T], which allow to refer about something, as for example the result of a generator, before this thing even exist


Warning, this is really not usual RTL description and aim large system generation.

Simple dummy example
--------------------

There is a simple example which define two Handle[Int] (a,b) and when loaded, will print the sum of them : 

.. code-block:: scala

  import spinal.lib.generator._

  class Root() extends Generator {
    //Define some Handle which will be later loaded with real values
    val a,b = Handle[Int]

    //Print a + b
    val calculator = new Generator {
      //Specify that this generator need a and b before executing his tasks
      dependencies += a
      dependencies += b

      //Create a new task that will run when all the dependencies are loaded
      add task {
        val sum = a.get + b.get
        println(s"a + b = $sum") // Will print a + b = 7
      }
    }

    //load a and b with values, which will then unlock the calculator generator
    a.load(3)
    b.load(4)
  }


So, the main point of that example is to show that we kind of overcome the sequential execution of things, as a and b are loaded after the definition of the calculator.

Then you can also chain generators via their handles. For instance we could add the following after the calculator definition : 

.. code-block:: scala

    //Generate a signal of signalWidth bits
    val rtl = new Generator {
      dependencies += signalWidth

      val signal = Handle[UInt]
      add task {
        println(s"rtlSignal will have ${signalWidth.get} bits") // Will print "rtlSignal will have 7 bits"
        signal.load(UInt(signalWidth.get bits))
      }
    }



Handle[T]
---------

Handle[T] are a bit like scala's Future[T], they allow to talk about something before it is even existing, and wait on it.

.. code-block:: scala
    
    val x,y = Handle[Int]
    val xPlus2 : Handle[Int] = x.produce(x.get + 2) //x.produce can be used to generate a new Handle when x is loaded
    val xPlus3 : Handle[Int] = x.derivate(_ + 3)    //x.derivate is as x.produce, but also provide the x.get as argument of the lambda function
    val xPlusY : Handle[Int] = List(x,y).produce(x.get + y.get) //As x.produce, but wait all the element of the list.
    x.load(3) //x will now contain the value 3

Generator
---------


A Generator is composed of : 

- dependencies : List of Handles that should be loaded before executing the generator's tasks
- tasks : List of lambda function which should run once all dependencies are loaded
- products : List of Handles which are loaded by the generator's tasks

dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is multiple ways to add/create new dependencies : 

.. code-block:: scala

  class MyGenerator() extends Generator {
    dependencies += somebodyElseHandle

    val myHandle : Handle[Int] = createDependency[Int] // Create a unloaded Handle[Int]
  }


tasks
^^^^^

.. code-block:: scala

  class MyGenerator() extends Generator {
    val width = createDependency[Int]
    val logic = add task new Area {
      val a,b,c = UInt(width.get bits)
      val result = a + b + c
    }
  }

products
^^^^^^^^

Telling the generator all your products isn't mandatory but help debugging. 


.. code-block:: scala

  // At a low level API :
  class MyGenerator() extends Generator {
    val interface = Handle[Apb3]
    products += interface
    val rtl = add task new Area {
      val bus = Apb3(32,32)
      interface.load(bus)
    }
  }
  
  // The same but less verbose
  class MyGenerator() extends Generator {
    val interface = this.produce(rtl.bus)
    val rtl = add task new Area {
      val bus = Apb3(32,32)
    }
  }
