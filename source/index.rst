Spinal Hardware Description Language
====================================

Welcome to SpinalHDL's documentation!

SpinalHDL is an open source high-level hardware description language. It can be
used as an alternative to VHDL or Verilog and has several advantages over them:

* It focuses on efficient hardware description instead of being event-driven.
* It is embedded into a general purpose programming language, enabling powerful
  hardware generation.

More detailed introduction of the language in :ref:`Introduction/SpinalHDL`
