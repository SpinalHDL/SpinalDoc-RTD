msgid "The semantics behind SpinalHDL are important to learn, so that you understand what is really happening behind the scenes, and how to control it."

msgid "An assignment to a register is like expressing a rule which is applied on each cycle of its clock domain"

msgid "For example, both of the following pieces of code are equivalent:"

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:28
msgid "This is equivalent to:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:37
msgid "More generally, when you use the ``:=`` assignment operator, it's like specifying an additional new rule for the left side signal/register."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:40
msgid "Last valid assignment wins"
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:42
msgid "If a combinational signal or register is assigned multiple times through the use of the SpinalHDL ``:=`` operator, the last assignment that may execute wins (and so gets to set the value as a result for this state)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:46
msgid "It could be said that top to bottom evaluation occurs based on the state that exists at that time.  If your upstream signal inputs are driven from registers and so have synchronous behaviour, then it could be said that at each clock cycle the assignments are re-evaluated based on the new state at the time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:51
msgid "Some reasons why an assignment statement may not get to execute in hardware this clock cycle, maybe due to it being wrapped in a ``when(cond)`` clause."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:54
msgid "Another reason maybe that the SpinalHDL code never made it through elaboration because the feature was paramaterized and disabled during HDL code-generation, see ``paramIsFalse`` use below."

msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:174
msgid "All of the previous examples are strictly equivalent both in their generated RTL and also in the SpinalHDL compiler's perspective. This is because SpinalHDL only cares about the Scala runtime and the objects instantiated there, it doesn't care about the Scala syntax itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Semantic/rules.rst:177
msgid "In other words, from a generated RTL generation / SpinalHDL perspective, when you use functions in Scala which generate hardware, it is like the function was inlined. This is also true case for Scala loops, as they will appear in unrolled form in the generated RTL."
