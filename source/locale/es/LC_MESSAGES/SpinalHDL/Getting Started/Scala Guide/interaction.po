msgid "SpinalHDL is, in fact, not an language: it's a regular Scala library. This could seem strange at first glance, but it is a very powerful combination."

msgid "You can use the whole Scala world to help you in the description of your hardware via the SpinalHDL library, but to do that properly, it's important to understand how SpinalHDL interacts with Scala."

msgid "When you execute your SpinalHDL hardware description, each time you use SpinalHDL functions, operators, or classes, it will build an in-memory graph that represents the netlist of your design."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/Scala Guide/interaction.rst:17
msgid "Then, when the elaboration is done (instantiation of your top-level ``Component`` classes), SpinalHDL will do some passes on the graph that was constructed, and if everything is fine, it will flush that graph into a VHDL or Verilog file."

msgid "Everything is a reference"
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/Scala Guide/interaction.rst:22
msgid "For example, if you define a Scala function which takes a parameter of type ``Bits``, when you call it, it will be passed as a reference. As consequence of that, if you assign that argument inside the function, it has the same effect on the underlying ``Bits`` object as if you had assigned to it outside the function."

msgid "To name signals in the generated RTL, SpinalHDL uses Java reflections to walk through your entire component hierarchy, collecting all references stored inside the class attributes, and naming them with their attribute name."

msgid "This is why the names of every signal defined inside a function are lost:"
