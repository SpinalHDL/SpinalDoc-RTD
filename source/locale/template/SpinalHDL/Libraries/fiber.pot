msgid "This framework is not expected to be used for general RTL generation and targets large system design management and code generation. It is currently used as toplevel integration tool in SaxonSoC."

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Libraries/fiber.rst:15
msgid "The Fiber to run the hardware elaboration in a out of order manner, a bit similarly to Makefile, where you can define rules and dependencies which will then be solved when you run a make command. It is very similar to the Scala Future feature."

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Libraries/fiber.rst:19
msgid "You can define things before even knowing all their requirements, ex : instantiating a interruption controller, before knowing how many interrupt signal lines you need"
