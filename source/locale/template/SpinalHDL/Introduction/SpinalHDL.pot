#: ../../SpinalHDL/Introduction/SpinalHDL.rst:9
msgid "SpinalHDL is an open source high-level hardware description language with associated tools. Its development started in December 2014."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Introduction/SpinalHDL.rst:12
msgid "SpinalHDL makes it possible to efficiently describe hardware, giving names to digital hardware notions; the most obvious examples are ``Reg`` and ``Latch``. In event-driven languages such as VHDL and Verilog, to use these two common elements, the user has to describe how to simulate them with a process, so that the synthesis tool can infer what cell it is. With SpinalHDL, you just have to declare a ``Reg`` or a ``Latch``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Introduction/SpinalHDL.rst:42
msgid "SpinalHDL is not an HLS tool: its goal is not to automagically transform an abstract algorithm into a digital circuit. Its goal is to create a new abstraction level by naming things, to help the designer reuse their code and not write the same thing over and over again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Introduction/SpinalHDL.rst:47
msgid "SpinalHDL is not an analog modeling language. VHDL and Verilog make it possible for analog designers to provide a model of their IP to digital designers. SpinalHDL does not address this case, and is for digital designers to describe their own digital designs."
