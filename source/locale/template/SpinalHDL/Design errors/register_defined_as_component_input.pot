msgid "In SpinalHDL, you are not allowed to define a component that has a register as an input. The reasoning behind this is to prevent surprises when the user tries to drive the inputs of child components with the registered signal. If a registered input is desired, you will need to declare the unregistered input in the ``io`` bundle, and register the signal in the body of the component."
