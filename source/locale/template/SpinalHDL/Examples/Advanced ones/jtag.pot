msgid "Of course a simple JTAG TAP implementation could be done only with a simple hardware description, but the goal here is really to going forward and creating an very reusable and extensible JTAG TAP generator"

msgid "One big difference between commonly used HDL and Spinal, is the fact that SpinalHDL allow you to define hardware generators/builders. It's very different than describing hardware. Let's take a look into the example bellow because the difference between generate/build/describing could seem \"playing with word\" or could be interpreted differently."

msgid "The example bellow is a JTAG TAP which allow the JTAG master to read ``switchs``\\ /\\ ``keys`` inputs and write ``leds`` outputs. This TAP could also be recognized by a master by using the UID 0x87654321."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Examples/Advanced ones/jtag.rst:28
msgid "As you can see, a JtagTap is created but then some Generator/Builder functions (idcode,read,write) are called to create each JTAG instruction. This is what i call \"Hardware generator/builder\", then these Generator/Builder are used by the user to describing an hardware. And there is the point, in commonly HDL you can only describe your hardware, which imply many donkey job."
