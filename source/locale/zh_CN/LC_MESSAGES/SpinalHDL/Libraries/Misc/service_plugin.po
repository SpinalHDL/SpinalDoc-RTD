"For some design, instead of implementing your Component's hardware "
"directly in it, you may instead want to compose its hardware by using "
"some sorts of Plugins. This can provide a few key features :"
msgstr ""

"You can extend the features of your component by adding new plugins in "
"its parameters. For instance adding Floating point support in a CPU."

"You can swap various implementations of the same functionality just by "
"using another set of plugins. For instance one implementation of a CPU "
"multiplier may fit well on some FPGA, while others may fit well on ASIC."

"It avoid the very very very large hand written toplevel syndrom where "

"plugins."

"VexRiscv and NaxRiscv projects are an example of this. Their are CPUs "

"While VexRiscv use a strict synchronous 2 phase system (setup/build "
