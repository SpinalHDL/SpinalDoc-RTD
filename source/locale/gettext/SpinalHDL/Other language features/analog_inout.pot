msgid "You can define native tristate signals by using the ``Analog``/``inout`` features. These features were added for the following reasons:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Being able to add native tristate signals to the toplevel (it avoids having to manually wrap them with some hand-written VHDL/Verilog)."

msgid "As those features were only added for convenience, please do not try other fancy stuff with tristate logic just yet."

msgid "If you want to model a component like a memory-mapped GPIO peripheral, please use the :ref:`TriState/TriStateArray <section-tristate>` bundles from the Spinal standard library, which abstract over the true nature of tristate drivers."

msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Other language features/analog_inout.rst:24
msgid "``Analog`` is the keyword which allows a signal to be defined as something analog, which in the digital world could mean ``0``, ``1``, or ``Z`` (the disconnected, high-impedance state)."

msgid "InOutWrapper"
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Other language features/analog_inout.rst:63
msgid "``InOutWrapper`` is a tool which allows you to transform all ``master`` ``TriState``/``TriStateArray``/``ReadableOpenDrain`` bundles of a component into native ``inout(Analog(...))`` signals. It allows you to keep your hardware description free of any ``Analog``/``inout`` things, and then transform the toplevel to make it synthesis ready."
