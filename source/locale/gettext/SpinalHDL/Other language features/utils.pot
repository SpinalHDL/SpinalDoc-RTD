#: ../../SpinalHDL/Other language features/utils.rst:158
msgid "Notice how the example above uses a ``HardType`` wrapper around the raw data type ``T``, which is a \"blueprint\" definition of a hardware data type. This way of doing things is easier to use than the \"old way\", because to create a new instance of the hardware data type you only need to call the ``apply`` function of that ``HardType`` (or in other words, just add parentheses after the parameter)."
