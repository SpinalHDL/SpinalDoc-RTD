msgid "But ``sbt`` has a quite long boot time so the we recommend to use its interactive mode:"

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/SBT.rst:22
msgid "Now ``sbt`` shows a prompt. Let's start by doing Scala compilation. It will fetch dependencies so it can take time the first time:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/SBT.rst:29
msgid "Actually you never need to just ``compile`` as it is done automatically when needed. The first build time will take a few moments longer compared to future builds as the sbt tool builds the entire project from a cold start and then uses incremental building where possible from that point on.  ``sbt`` supports autocompletion inside the interactive shell to assist discovery and usage of the available commands. You can start the interactive shell with ``sbt shell`` or running ``sbt`` with no arguments from the command line."

msgid "To run a specific HDL code-generation or simulation, the command is ``runMain``. So if you type ``runMain``, space, and tab, you should get this:"

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/SBT.rst:83
msgid "So now, each time you save a source file, it will re-generate ``MyTopLevel.v``. To do this, it automatically compiles the source files and it performs lint checks. This way you can get errors printed on the terminal almost in real-time while you are editing the source files."

msgid "You can press Enter to stop automatic generation, then Ctrl-D to exit ``sbt``."
