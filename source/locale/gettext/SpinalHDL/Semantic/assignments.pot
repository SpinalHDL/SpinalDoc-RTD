msgid "When muxing (for instance using ``when``, see :doc:`when_switch`.), the last valid standard assignment ``:=`` wins. Else, assigning twice to the same assignee from the same scope results in an assignment overlap.  SpinalHDL will assume this is a unintentional design error by default and halt elaboration with error. For special use-cases assignment overlap can be programatically permitted on a case by case basis. (see :doc:`../Design errors/assignment_overlap`)."

msgid "It is important to understand that in SpinalHDL, the nature of a signal (combinational/sequential) is defined in its declaration, not by the way it is assigned.

msgid "Because ``U(3)`` is a \"weak\" bit count inferred signal, SpinalHDL widens it automatically. This can be considered to be functionally equivalent to ``U(3, 2 bits).resized`` However rest reassured SpinalHDL will do the correct thing and continue to flag an error if the scenario would require narrowing. An error is reported if the literal required 9 bits (e.g. ``U(0x100)``) when trying to assign into ``myUIntOf_8bits``."
