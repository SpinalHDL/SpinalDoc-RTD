msgid "It is recommended that v4.218 is the oldest Verilator version to use.  While it maybe possible to use older verilator versions, some optional and Scala source dependent features that SpinalHDL can use (such as Verilog ``$urandom`` support) may not be supported by older Verilator versions and will cause an error when trying to simulate."
