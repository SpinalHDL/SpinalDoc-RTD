msgid "When building a pipeline, only ``node(0).valid`` or ``node(n).ready`` (where ``n`` is the last stage in the pipeline) may be driven by user logic. It is possible for the builder to optimise away ``node.ready`` or ``node.valid`` signals if they are not used. To guarantee ``node.ready`` or ``node.valid`` signal creation (important if you use ``CtrlLink()`` or any other link where you want flow control) ``node(0).valid`` must be driven manually."
