msgid "The ``reg3`` example above shows how you can assign the value of a ``RegInit`` register. It's possible to use the same syntax to assign to the other register types as well (``Reg``, ``RegNext``, ``RegNextWhen``). Just like in combinational assignments, the rule is 'Last assignment wins', but if no assignment is done, the register keeps its value. If the Reg is declared in a design and does not have suitable assignment and consumption it is likely to be pruned (removed from design) at some point by EDA flows after being deemed unnecessary."

msgid "Sometimes it is useful to transform an existing signal into a register. For instance, when you are using a ``Bundle``, if you want some outputs of the bundle to be registers, you might prefer to write ``io.myBundle.PORT := newValue`` without declaring registers with ``val PORT = Reg(...)`` and connecting their output to the port with ``io.myBundle.PORT := PORT``. To do this, you just need to use ``.setAsReg()`` on the ports you want to control as registers:"
