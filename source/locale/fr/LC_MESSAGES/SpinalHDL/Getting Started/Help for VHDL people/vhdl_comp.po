msgid "Processes are often needed when you write RTL, however, their semantics can be clunky to work with. Due to how they work in VHDL, they can force you to split your code and duplicate things."

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/Help for VHDL people/vhdl_comp.rst:75
msgid "In VHDL, when you declare a signal, you don't specify if it is a combinatorial signal or a register. Where and how you assign to it decides whether it is combinatorial or registered."

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/Help for VHDL people/vhdl_comp.rst:77

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/Help for VHDL people/vhdl_comp.rst:82
msgid "In VHDL, every time you want to define a bunch of registers, you need the carry the clock and the reset wire to them. In addition, you have to hardcode everywhere how those clock and reset signals should be used (clock edge, reset polarity, reset nature (async, sync))."

msgid "In VHDL, there is a ``block`` feature that allows you to define sub-areas of logic inside your component. However, almost no one uses this feature, because most people don't know about them, and also because all signals defined inside these regions are not readable from the outside."

msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/Help for VHDL people/vhdl_comp.rst:136
msgid "In VHDL as in SpinalHDL, it's easy to write combinatorial loops, or to infer a latch by forgetting to drive a signal in the path of a process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Getting Started/Help for VHDL people/vhdl_comp.rst:138
msgid "Then, to detect those issues, you can use some ``lint`` tools that will analyze your VHDL, but those tools aren't free. In SpinalHDL the ``lint`` process in integrated inside the compiler, and it won't generate the RTL code until everything is fine. It also checks clock domain crossing."
