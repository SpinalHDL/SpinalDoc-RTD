msgid "As always, you can use your standard simulation tools to simulate the VHDL/Verilog generated by SpinalHDL. However, since SpinalHDL 1.0.0, the language integrates an API to write testbenches and test your hardware directly in Scala. This API provides the capabilities to read and write the DUT signals, fork and join simulation processes, sleep and wait until a given condition is reached. Therefore, using SpinalHDL's simulation API, it is easy to integrate testbenches with the most common Scala unit-test frameworks."
