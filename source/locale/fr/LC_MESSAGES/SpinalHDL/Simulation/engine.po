msgid "There are some practical uses of those primitives:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Simulation/engine.rst:23
msgid "Sensitive callbacks can be used to wake up a simulation thread when a given condition happens, like a rising edge on a clock."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Simulation/engine.rst:24
msgid "Delayed callbacks can be used to schedule stimuli, such as deasserting a reset after a given time, or toggling the clock."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Simulation/engine.rst:25
msgid "Both sensitive and delayed callbacks can be used to resume a simulation thread."
msgstr ""

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Simulation/engine.rst:26
msgid "A simulation thread can be used (for instance) to produce stimulus and check the DUT's output values."

#: ../../SpinalHDL/Simulation/engine.rst:27
msgid "The command buffer's purpose is mainly to avoid all concurrency issues between the DUT and the testbench."
