SpinalHDL uses two licenses, one for ``spinal.core`` and one for ``spinal.lib``
and everything else in the repository.

``spinal.core`` (the compiler) is under the LGPL license, which can be
summarized as follows:

* You can make money with your SpinalHDL description and its generated RTL.
* You don't have to share your SpinalHDL description and its generated RTL.
* There are no fees and no royalties.
* If your make improvements to the SpinalHDL core, and you wish to
  redistribute those modifications, you have to share those modifications
  to make the tool better for everybody.

``spinal.lib`` (a general purpose library of components/tools/interfaces) is
under the permissive MIT license so you do not have to share it, even if
contributions are really appreciated.
