     - | Apply a mask on x to only keep the bit set from ``requests``.
       | it start looking in ``requests`` from the ``ohPriority`` position.
       | For example if ``requests`` is "1001" and ``ohPriority`` is "0010", the ``roundRobin`` function will start looking in `requests` from its second bit and will return "1000".

       |   oneHot : IndexedSeq[Bool],
       |   inputs : Iterable[T]
       | )

       | )

   * - | PriorityMux (
       |    in:  Seq[(Bool, T)]
       | )
     - T
     - Return the first ``in`` element whose ``sel`` is ``True``.

   * - History(that: T, length: Int[,when : Bool])
     - List[T]
     - | Return a Vec of ``length`` elements
       | The first element is ``that``\ , the last one is ``that`` delayed by ``length``\ -1\
       | The internal shift register sample when ``when`` is asserted
   * - BufferCC(input : T)
     - T
     - Return the input signal synchronized with the current clock domain by using 2 flip flop


Counter
^^^^^^^

The Counter tool can be used to easily instantiate a hardware counter.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1

   * - Instantiation syntax
     - Notes
   * - ``Counter(start: BigInt, end: BigInt[, inc : Bool])``
     - 
   * - ``Counter(range : Range[, inc : Bool])``
     - Compatible with the  ``x to y`` ``x until y`` syntaxes
   * - ``Counter(stateCount: BigInt[, inc : Bool])``
     - Starts at zero and ends at ``stateCount - 1``
   * - ``Counter(bitCount: BitCount[, inc : Bool])``
     - Starts at zero and ends at ``(1 << bitCount) - 1``

A counter can be controlled by methods, and wires can be read:

.. code-block:: scala

   val counter = Counter(2 to 9) // Creates a counter of 8 states (2 to 9)
   // Methods
   counter.clear()               // Resets the counter
   counter.increment()           // Increments the counter
   // Wires
   counter.value                 // Current value
   counter.valueNext             // Next value
   counter.willOverflow          // True if the counter overflows this cycle
   counter.willOverflowIfInc     // True if the counter would overflow this cycle if an increment was done
   // Cast
   when(counter === 5){ ... }    // counter is implicitly casted to its current value

When a ``Counter`` overflows (reached end value), it restarts the next cycle to its start value.

.. note::
   Currently, only up counter are supported.

``CounterFreeRun`` builds an always running counter: ``CounterFreeRun(stateCount: BigInt)``.

Timeout
^^^^^^^

The Timeout tool can be used to easily instantiate an hardware timeout.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1

   * - Instanciation syntax
     - Notes
   * - Timeout(cycles : BigInt)
     - Tick after ``cycles`` clocks
   * - Timeout(time : TimeNumber)
     - Tick after a ``time`` duration
   * - Timeout(frequency : HertzNumber)
     - Tick at an ``frequency`` rate


There is an example of different syntaxes which could be used with the Counter tool

.. code-block:: scala

   val timeout = Timeout(10 ms)  //Timeout who tick after 10 ms
   when(timeout) {               //Check if the timeout has tick
       timeout.clear()           //Ask the timeout to clear its flag
   }

.. note::
   If you instantiate an ``Timeout`` with an time or frequency setup, the implicit ``ClockDomain`` should have an frequency setting.

ResetCtrl
^^^^^^^^^

The ResetCtrl provide some utilities to manage resets.

asyncAssertSyncDeassert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter an asynchronous reset by using an asynchronously asserted synchronously deaserted logic. To do it you can use the ``ResetCtrl.asyncAssertSyncDeassert`` function which will return you the filtered value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1 4

   * - Argument name
     - Type
     - Description
   * - input
     - Bool
     - Signal that should be filtered
   * - clockDomain
     - ClockDomain
     - ClockDomain which will use the filtered value
   * - inputPolarity
     - Polarity
     - HIGH/LOW (default=HIGH)
   * - outputPolarity
     - Polarity
     - HIGH/LOW (default=clockDomain.config.resetActiveLevel)
   * - bufferDepth
     - Int
     - Number of register stages used to avoid metastability (default=2)


There is also an ``ResetCtrl.asyncAssertSyncDeassertDrive`` version of tool which directly assign the ``clockDomain`` reset with the filtered value.
