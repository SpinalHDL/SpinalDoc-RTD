Cloning hardware datatypes
--------------------------

You can clone a given hardware data type by using the ``cloneOf(x)`` function.
It will return a new instance of the same Scala type and parameters.

For example:

.. code-block:: scala

   def plusOne(value : UInt) : UInt = {
     // Will recreate a UInt with the same width than ``value``
     val temp = cloneOf(value)
     temp := value + 1
     return temp
   }

   // treePlusOne will become a 8 bits value
   val treePlusOne = plusOne(U(3, 8 bits))

You can get more information about how hardware data types are managed on the :ref:`Hardware types page <hardware_type>`.

.. note::
   If you use the ``cloneOf`` function on a ``Bundle``, this ``Bundle`` should be a ``case class`` or should override the clone function internally.


Passing a datatype as construction parameter
--------------------------------------------

Many pieces of reusable hardware need to be parameterized by some data type.
For example if you want to define a FIFO or a shift register, you need a parameter to specify which kind of payload you want for the component.

There are two similar ways to do this.

The old way
^^^^^^^^^^^

A good example of the old way to do this is in this definition of a ``ShiftRegister`` component:

.. code-block:: scala

   case class ShiftRegister[T <: Data](dataType: T, depth: Int) extends Component {
     val io = new Bundle {
       val input  = in (cloneOf(dataType))
       val output = out(cloneOf(dataType))
     }
     // ...
   }

And here is how you can instantiate the component:

.. code-block:: scala

   val shiftReg = ShiftRegister(Bits(32 bits), depth = 8)

As you can see, the raw hardware type is directly passed as a construction parameter.
Then each time you want to create an new instance of that kind of hardware data type, you need to use the ``cloneOf(...)`` function.
Doing things this way is not super safe as it's easy to forget to use ``cloneOf``.

The safe way
^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example of the safe way to pass a data type parameter is as follows:

.. code-block:: scala

   case class ShiftRegister[T <: Data](dataType: HardType[T], depth: Int) extends Component {
     val io = new Bundle {
       val input  = in (dataType())
       val output = out(dataType())
     }
     // ...
   }

And here is how you instantiate the component (exactly the same as before):

.. code-block:: scala

   val shiftReg = ShiftRegister(Bits(32 bits), depth = 8)

Notice how the example above uses a ``HardType`` wrapper around the raw data type ``T``, which is a "blueprint" definition of a hardware data type.
This way of doing things is easier to use than the "old way", because to create a new instance of the hardware data type you only need to call the ``apply`` function of that ``HardType`` (or in other words, just add parentheses after the parameter).

Additionally, this mechanism is completely transparent from the point of view of the user, as a hardware data type can be implicitly converted into a ``HardType``.

Frequency and time
------------------

SpinalHDL has a dedicated syntax to define frequency and time values:

.. code-block:: scala

   val frequency = 100 MHz
   val timeoutLimit = 3 ms
   val period = 100 us

   val periodCycles = frequency * period
   val timeoutCycles = frequency * timeoutLimit

| For time definitions you can use following postfixes to get a ``TimeNumber``:
| ``fs``, ``ps``, ``ns``, ``us``, ``ms``, ``sec``, ``mn``, ``hr``

| For time definitions you can use following postfixes to get a ``HertzNumber``:
| ``Hz``, ``KHz``, ``MHz``, ``GHz``, ``THz``

``TimeNumber`` and ``HertzNumber`` are based on the ``PhysicalNumber`` class which use  scala ``BigDecimal`` to store numbers.

Binary prefix
-------------

SpinalHDL allows the definition of integer numbers using binary prefix notation according to IEC.

.. code-block:: scala

   val memSize = 512 MiB
   val dpRamSize = 4 KiB

The following binary prefix notations are available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 2

   * - Binary Prefix
     - Value
   * - Byte, Bytes
     - 1
   * - KiB
     - 1024 == 1 << 10
   * - MiB
     - 1024\ :sup:`2` == 1 << 20
   * - GiB
     - 1024\ :sup:`3` == 1 << 30
   * - TiB
     - 1024\ :sup:`4` == 1 << 40
   * - PiB
     - 1024\ :sup:`5` == 1 << 50
   * - EiB
     - 1024\ :sup:`6` == 1 << 60
   * - ZiB
     - 1024\ :sup:`7` == 1 << 70
   * - YiB
     - 1024\ :sup:`8` == 1 << 80
