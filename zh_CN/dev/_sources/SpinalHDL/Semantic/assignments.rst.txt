Assignments
===========

Assignments
-----------

There are multiple assignment operators:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 5

   * - Symbol
     - Description
   * - ``:=``
     - Standard assignment, equivalent to ``<=`` in VHDL/Verilog. The last assignment to a variable wins; the value is not updated until the next simulation delta cycle.
   * - ``\=``
     - Equivalent to ``:=`` in VHDL and ``=`` in Verilog. The value is updated instantly in-place.
   * - ``<>``
     - Automatic connection between 2 signals or two bundles of the same type. Direction is inferred by using signal direction (in/out). (Similar behavior to ``:=``\ )


.. code-block:: scala

   // Because of hardware concurrency, `a` is always read as '1' by b and c
   val a, b, c = UInt(4 bits)
   a := 0
   b := a
   a := 1  // a := 1 "wins"
   c := a  

   var x = UInt(4 bits)
   val y, z = UInt(4 bits)
   x := 0
   y := x      // y read x with the value 0
   x \= x + 1
   z := x      // z read x with the value 1

   // Automatic connection between two UART interfaces.
   uartCtrl.io.uart <> io.uart

It also support Bundle assignment, Bundle multiple signals together use ``()`` to assign and assign to

.. code-block:: scala

   val a, b, c = UInt(4 bits)
   val d       = UInt(12 bits)
   val e       = Bits(10 bits)
   val f       = SInt(2  bits)
   val g       = Bits()

   (a, b, c) := B(0, 12 bits)
   (a, b, c) := d.asBits
   (a, b, c) := (e, f).asBits
   g         := (a, b, c, e, f).asBits

It is important to understand that in SpinalHDL, the nature of a signal (combinational/sequential) is defined in its declaration, not by the way it is assigned.
All datatype instances will define a combinational signal, while a datatype instance wrapped with ``Reg(...)`` will define a sequential (registered) signal.

.. code-block:: scala

   val a = UInt(4 bits) // Define a combinational signal
   val b = Reg(UInt(4 bits)) // Define a registered signal
   val c = Reg(UInt(4 bits)) init(0) // Define a registered signal which is set to 0 when a reset occurs

Width checking
--------------

SpinalHDL checks that the bit count of the left side and the right side of an assignment matches. There are multiple ways to adapt the width of a given BitVector (``Bits``, ``UInt``, ``SInt``):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 2 5

   * - Resizing techniques
     - Description
   * - x := y.resized
     - Assign x with a resized copy of y, resize value is automatically inferred to match x
   * - x := y.resize(newWidth)
     - Assign x with a resized copy of y, size is manually calculated


There is one case where Spinal automatically resizes a value:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 7 10 10

   * - Assignment
     - Problem
     - SpinalHDL action
   * - myUIntOf_8bit := U(3)
     - U(3) creates an UInt of 2 bits, which doesn't match the left side (8 bits)
     - Because U(3) is a "weak" bit count inferred signal, SpinalHDL resizes it automatically


Combinatorial loops
-------------------

SpinalHDL checks that there are no combinatorial loops (latches) in your design.
If one is detected, it raises an error and SpinalHDL will print the path of the loop.
