The ``spinal.core`` components
==============================
The core components of the language are described in this document. It is part of the general

.. :ref:`SpinalHDL user guide <userGuide>`.

The core language components are as follows:

* :ref:`*Clock domains* <core_components_clock_domain_definition>`, which allow to define and interoperate multiple clock domains within a design
* *Memory instantiation*\ , which permit the automatic instantiation of RAM and ROM memories.
* *IP instantiation*\ , using either existing VHDL or Verilog component.
* Assignments
* When / Switch
* Component hierarchy
* Area
* Functions
* Utility functions
* VHDL generator

Clock domains definitions
-------------------------

In *Spinal*\ , clock and reset signals can be combined to create a **clock domain**. Clock domains could be applied to some area of the design and then all synchronous elements instantiated into this area will then **implicitly** use this clock domain.

Clock domain application work like a stack, which mean, if you are in a given clock domain, you can still apply another clock domain locally.


.. _core_componets_clock_constructor:

Clock domain syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The syntax to define a clock domain is as follows (using EBNF syntax):

``ClockDomain(clock : Bool[,reset : Bool[,enable : Bool]]])``

This definition takes three parameters:


#. The clock signal that defines the domain
#. An optional ``reset``\ signal. If a register which need a reset and his clock domain didn't provide one, an error message happen
#. An optional ``enable`` signal. The goal of this signal is to disable the clock on the whole clock domain without having to  manually implement that on each synchronous element.

An applied example to define a specific clock domain within the design is as follows:

.. code-block:: scala

   val coreClock = Bool()
   val coreReset = Bool()

   // Define a new clock domain
   val coreClockDomain = ClockDomain(coreClock,coreReset)

   ...

   // Use this domain in an area of the design
   val coreArea = new ClockingArea(coreClockDomain){
     val coreClockedRegister = Reg(UInt(4 bits))
   }

Clock configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the constructor parameters given :ref:`here <core_componets_clock_constructor>` , the following elements of each clock domain are configurable via a ``ClockDomainConfig`` class :

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1

   * - Property
     - Valid values
   * - ``clockEdge``
     - ``RISING``\ , ``FALLING``
   * - ``ResetKind``
     - ``ASYNC``\ , ``SYNC``
   * - ``resetActiveHigh``
     - ``true``\ , ``false``
   * - ``clockEnableActiveHigh``
     - ``true``\ , ``false``


.. code-block:: scala

   class CustomClockExample extends Component {
     val io = new Bundle {
       val clk = in Bool()
       val resetn = in Bool()
       val result = out UInt (4 bits)
     }
     val myClockDomainConfig = ClockDomainConfig(
       clockEdge = RISING,
       resetKind = ASYNC,
       resetActiveLevel = LOW
     )
     val myClockDomain = ClockDomain(io.clk,io.resetn,config = myClockDomainConfig)
     val myArea = new ClockingArea(myClockDomain){
       val myReg = Reg(UInt(4 bits)) init(7)
       myReg := myReg + 1

       io.result := myReg
     }
   }

By default, a ClockDomain is applied to the whole design. The configuration of this one is :


* clock : rising edge
* reset: asynchronous, active high
* no enable signal

External clock
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define everywhere a clock domain which is driven by the outside. It will then automatically add clock and reset wire from the top level inputs to all synchronous elements.

.. code-block:: scala

   class ExternalClockExample extends Component {
     val io = new Bundle {
       val result = out UInt (4 bits)
     }
     val myClockDomain = ClockDomain.external("myClockName")
     val myArea = new ClockingArea(myClockDomain){
       val myReg = Reg(UInt(4 bits)) init(7)
       myReg := myReg + 1

       io.result := myReg
     }
   }

Cross Clock Domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SpinalHDL checks at compile time that there is no unwanted/unspecified cross clock domain signal reads. If you want to read a signal that is emitted by another ``ClockDomain`` area, you should add the ``crossClockDomain`` tag to the destination signal as depicted in the following example:

.. code-block:: scala

   val asynchronousSignal = UInt(8 bits)
   ...
   val buffer0 = Reg(UInt(8 bits)).addTag(crossClockDomain)
   val buffer1 = Reg(UInt(8 bits))
   buffer0 := asynchronousSignal
   buffer1 := buffer0   // Second register stage to be avoid metastability issues

.. code-block:: scala

   // Or in less lines:
   val buffer0 = RegNext(asynchronousSignal).addTag(crossClockDomain)
   val buffer1 = RegNext(buffer0)

Assignments
-----------

There are multiple assignment operator :

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 5

   * - Symbole
     - Description
   * - :=
     - | Standard assignment, equivalent to '<=' in VHDL/Verilog
       | last assignment win, value updated at next delta cycle
   * - /=
     - | Equivalent to := in VHDL and = in Verilog
       | value updated instantly
   * - <>
     - | Automatic connection between 2 signals. Direction is inferred by using signal direction (in/out)
       | Similar behavioural than :=


.. code-block:: scala

   //Because of hardware concurrency is always read with the value '1' by b and c
   val a,b,c = UInt(4 bits)
   a := 0
   b := a
   a := 1  //a := 1 win
   c := a  

   var x = UInt(4 bits)
   val y,z = UInt(4 bits)
   x := 0
   y := x      //y read x with the value 0
   x \= x + 1
   z := x      //z read x with the value 1

SpinalHDL check that bitcount of left and right assignment side match. There is multiple ways to adapt bitcount of BitVector (Bits, UInt, SInt) :

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 2

   * - Resizing ways
     - Description
   * - x := y.resized
     - Assign x wit a resized copy of y, resize value is automatically inferred to match x
   * - x := y.resize(newWidth)
     - Assign x with a resized copy of y, size is manually calculated


There are 2 cases where spinal automaticly resize things :

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 3 2 1

   * - Assignement
     - Problem
     - SpinalHDL action
   * - myUIntOf_8bit := U(3)
     - U(3) create an UInt of 2 bits, which don't match with left side
     - Because  U(3) is a "weak" bit inferred signal, SpinalHDL resize it automatically
   * - myUIntOf_8bit := U(2 -> False default -> true)
     - The right part infer a 3 bit UInt, which doesn't match with the left part
     - SpinalHDL reapply the default value to bit that are missing


When / Switch
-------------

As VHDL and Verilog, wire and register can be conditionally assigned by using when and switch syntaxes

.. code-block:: scala

   when(cond1){
     //execute when      cond1 is true
   }.elsewhen(cond2){
     //execute when (not cond1) and cond2
   }.otherwise{
     //execute when (not cond1) and (not cond2)
   }

   switch(x){
     is(value1){
       //execute when x === value1
     }
     is(value2){
       //execute when x === value2
     }
     default{
       //execute if none of precedent condition meet
     }
   }

You can also define new signals into a when/switch statement. It's useful if you want to calculate an intermediate value.

.. code-block:: scala

   val toto,titi = UInt(4 bits)
   val a,b = UInt(4 bits)

   when(cond){
     val tmp = a + b
     toto := tmp
     titi := tmp + 1
   } otherwise {
     toto := 0
     titi := 0
   }

Component/Hierarchy
-------------------

Like in VHDL and Verilog, you can define components that could be used to build a design hierarchy.  But unlike them, you don't need to bind them at instantiation.

.. code-block:: scala

   class AdderCell extends Component {
     //Declaring all in/out in an io Bundle is probably a good practice
     val io = new Bundle {
       val a, b, cin = in Bool
       val sum, cout = out Bool
     }
     //Do some logic
     io.sum := io.a ^ io.b ^ io.cin
     io.cout := (io.a & io.b) | (io.a & io.cin) | (io.b & io.cin)
   }

   class Adder(width: Int) extends Component {
     ...
     //Create 2 AdderCell
     val cell0 = new AdderCell
     val cell1 = new AdderCell
     cell1.io.cin := cell0.io.cout //Connect carrys
     ...
     val cellArray = Array.fill(width)(new AdderCell)
     ...
   }

Syntax to define in/out is the following :

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 2 3 1

   * - Syntax
     - Description
     - Return
   * - in/out(x : Data)
     - Set x an input/output
     - x
   * - in/out Bool
     - Create an input/output Bool
     - Bool
   * - in/out Bits/UInt/SInt[(x bits)]
     - Create an input/output of the corresponding type
     - T


There is some rules about component interconnection :


* Components can only read outputs/inputs signals of children components
* Components can read outputs/inputs ports values
* If for some reason, you need to read a signals from far away in the hierarchy (debug, temporal patch) you can do it by using the value returned by some.where.else.theSignal.pull().

Area
----

Sometime, creating a component to define some logic is overkill and to much verbose. For this kind of cases you can use Area :

.. code-block:: scala

   class UartCtrl extends Component {
     ...
     val timer = new Area {
       val counter = Reg(UInt(8 bits))
       val tick = counter === 0
       counter := counter - 1
       when(tick) {
         counter := 100
       }
     }
     val tickCounter = new Area {
       val value = Reg(UInt(3 bits))
       val reset = False
       when(timer.tick) {          // Refer to the tick from timer area
         value := value + 1
       }
       when(reset) {
         value := 0
       }
     }
     val stateMachine = new Area {
       ...
     }
   }

Function
--------

The ways you can use Scala functions to generate hardware are radically different than VHDL/Verilog for many reasons:


* You can instantiate register, combinatorial logic and component inside them.
* You don't have to play with ``process``\ /\ ``@always`` that limit the scope of assignment of signals
* | Everything work by reference, which allow many manipulation.
  | For example you can give to a function an bus as argument, then the function can internaly read/write it.
  | You can also return a Component, a Bus, are anything else from scala the scala world.

RGB to gray
^^^^^^^^^^^

For example if you want to convert a Red/Green/Blue color into a gray one by using coefficient, you can use functions to apply them :

.. code-block:: scala

   // Input RGB color
   val r,g,b = UInt(8 bits)

   // Define a function to multiply a UInt by a scala Float value.
   def coef(value : UInt,by : Float) : UInt = (value * U((255*by).toInt,8 bits) >> 8)

   //Calculate the gray level
   val gray = coef(r,0.3f) +
              coef(g,0.4f) +
              coef(b,0.3f)

Valid Ready Payload bus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For instance if you define a simple Valid Ready Payload bus, you can then define usefull function inside it.

.. code-block:: scala

   class MyBus(payloadWidth:  Int) extends Bundle {
     val valid = Bool
     val ready = Bool
     val payload = Bits(payloadWidth bits)

     //connect that to this
     def <<(that: MyBus) : Unit = {
       this.valid := that.valid
       that.ready := this.ready
       this.payload := that.payload
     }

     // Connect this to the FIFO input, return the fifo output
     def queue(size: Int): MyBus = {
       val fifo = new Fifo(payloadWidth, size)
       fifo.io.push << this
       return fifo.io.pop
     }
   }

VHDL generation
---------------

There is a small component and a ``main`` that generate the corresponding VHDL.

.. code-block:: scala

   // spinal.core contain all basics (Bool, UInt, Bundle, Reg, Component, ..)
   import spinal.core._

   //A simple component definition
   class MyTopLevel extends Component {
     //Define some input/output. Bundle like a VHDL record or a verilog struct.
     val io = new Bundle {
       val a = in Bool
       val b = in Bool
       val c = out Bool
     }

     //Define some asynchronous logic
     io.c := io.a & io.b
   }

   //This is the main of the project. It create a instance of MyTopLevel and
   //call the SpinalHDL library to flush it into a VHDL file.
   object MyMain {
     def main(args: Array[String]) {
       SpinalVhdl(new MyTopLevel)
     }
   }

   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 2 1

   * - Syntax
     - Description
   * - Mem(type : Data,size : Int)
     - Create a RAM
   * - Mem(type : Data,initialContent : Array[Data])

     - 
   * - mem.readSync(address,enable)
     - Synchronous read
     - T


Instanciate VHDL and Verilog IP
-------------------------------

 In some cases, it could be usefull to instanciate a VHDL or a Verilog component into a SpinalHDL design. To do that, you need to define BlackBox which is like a Component, but its internal implementation should be provided by a separate VHDL/Verilog file to the simulator/synthesis tool.

.. code-block:: scala

   class Ram_1w_1r(_wordWidth: Int, _wordCount: Int) extends BlackBox {
     val generic = new Generic {
       val wordCount = _wordCount
       val wordWidth = _wordWidth
     }

     val io = new Bundle {
       val clk = in Bool

       val wr = new Bundle {
         val en = in Bool
         val addr = in UInt (log2Up(_wordCount) bits)
         val data = in Bits (_wordWidth bits)
       }
       val rd = new Bundle {
         val en = in Bool
         val addr = in UInt (log2Up(_wordCount) bits)
         val data = out Bits (_wordWidth bits)
       }
     }

     mapClockDomain(clock=io.clk)
   }

Utils
-----

The SpinalHDL core contain some utils :

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 2 5 1

   * - Syntax
     - Description
     - Return
   * - log2Up(x : BigInt)
     - Return the number of bit needed to represent x states
     - Int
   * - isPow2(x : BigInt)
     - Return true if x is a power of two
     - Boolean


Much more tool and utils are present in spinal.lib
