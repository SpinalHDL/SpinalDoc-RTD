Briey Introduction
------------------

Briey is the name of a little FPGA SoC fully written in SpinalHDL. Goals of this project are multiple :


* Prove that SpinalHDL is a viable HDL alternative in non-trivial projects.
* Show advantage of SpinalHDL meta-hardware description capabilities in a concrete project.
* Provide a fully open source SoC.


Pinsec has followings hardware features:


* AXI4 interconnect for high speed busses
* APB3 interconnect for peripherals
* RISCV CPU with instruction cache, MUL/DIV extension and interrupt controller
* JTAG bridge to load binaries and debug the CPU
* SDRAM SDR controller
* On chip ram
* One UART controller
* One VGA controller
* Some timer module
* Some GPIO
