State machine
=============

Introduction
------------

In SpinalHDL you can define your state machine like in VHDL/Verilog, by using enumerations and switch/case statements. But in SpinalHDL you can also use a dedicated syntax.

The state machine below is implemented in the following examples:

.. image:: /asset/picture/fsm_simple.svg
   :align: center
   :width: 300

Style A:

.. code-block:: scala

   import spinal.lib.fsm._

   class TopLevel extends Component {
     val io = new Bundle {
       val result = out Bool()
     }

     val fsm = new StateMachine {
       val counter = Reg(UInt(8 bits)) init (0)
       io.result := False

       val stateA : State = new State with EntryPoint {
         whenIsActive(goto(stateB))
       }
       val stateB : State = new State {
         onEntry(counter := 0)
         whenIsActive {
           counter := counter + 1
           when(counter === 4) {
             goto(stateC)
           }
         }
         onExit(io.result := True)
       }
       val stateC : State = new State {
         whenIsActive(goto(stateA))
       }
     }
   }

Style B:

.. code-block:: scala

   import spinal.lib.fsm._

   class TopLevel extends Component {
     val io = new Bundle {
       val result = out Bool()
     }

     val fsm = new StateMachine{
       val stateA = new State with EntryPoint
       val stateB = new State
       val stateC = new State

       val counter = Reg(UInt(8 bits)) init (0)
       io.result := False

       stateA
         .whenIsActive(goto(stateB))

       stateB
         .onEntry(counter := 0)
         .whenIsActive {
           counter := counter + 1
           when(counter === 4) {
             goto(stateC)
           }
         }
         .onExit(io.result := True)

       stateC
         .whenIsActive(goto(stateA))
     }
   }

StateMachine
------------

``StateMachine`` is the base class. It manages the logic of the FSM.

.. code-block:: scala

   val myFsm = new StateMachine {
     // Definition of states
   }

``StateMachine`` also provides some accessors:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1 5

   * - Name
     - Return
     - Description
   * - ``isActive(state)``
     - ``Bool``
     - Returns ``True`` when the state machine is in the given state
   * - ``isEntering(state)``
     - ``Bool``
     - Returns ``True`` when the state machine is entering the given state

Entry point
^^^^^^^^^^^

A state can be defined as the entry point of the state machine by extending the EntryPoint trait:

.. code-block:: scala

   val stateA = new State with EntryPoint

Or by using ``setEntry(state)``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val stateA = new State
   setEntry(stateA)

Transitions
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Transitions are represented by ``goto(nextState)``, which schedules the state machine to be in ``nextState`` the next cycle.
* ``exit()`` schedules the state machine to be in the boot state the next cycle (or, in ``StateFsm``, to exit the current nested state machine).

These two functions can be used inside state definitions (see below) or using ``always { yourStatements }``,
which always applies ``yourStatements``, with a priority over states.

States
------

Multiple kinds of states can be used:

* ``State`` (the base one)
* ``StateDelay``
* ``StateFsm``
* ``StateParallelFsm``

Each of them provides the following functions to define the logic associated to them:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 10

   * - Name
     - Description
   * - | ``state.onEntry {``
       | ``  yourStatements``
       | ``}``
     - ``yourStatements`` is applied when the state machine is not in ``state`` and will be in ``state`` the next cycle
   * - | ``state.onExit {``
       | ``  yourStatements``
       | ``}``
     - ``yourStatements`` is applied when the state machine is in ``state`` and will be in another state the next cycle
   * - | ``state.whenIsActive {``
       | ``  yourStatements``
       | ``}``
     - ``yourStatements`` is applied when the state machine is in ``state``
   * - | ``state.whenIsNext {``
       | ``  yourStatements``
       | ``}``
     - ``yourStatements`` is executed when the state machine will be in ``state`` the next cycle (even if it is already in it)

``state.`` is implicit in a ``new State`` block:

.. image:: /asset/picture/fsm_stateb.svg
   :align: center
   :width: 300

.. code-block:: scala

   val stateB : State = new State {
     onEntry(counter := 0)
     whenIsActive {
       counter := counter + 1
       when(counter === 4) {
         goto(stateC)
       }
     }
     onExit(io.result := True)
   }

StateDelay
^^^^^^^^^^

``StateDelay`` allows to create a state which waits for a fixed number of cycles before executing statments in ``whenCompleted {...}``. The preferred way to use it is:

.. code-block:: scala

   val stateG : State = new StateDelay(cyclesCount=40) {
     whenCompleted {
       goto(stateH)
     }
   }

It can also be written in one line:

.. code-block:: scala

   val stateG : State = new StateDelay(40) { whenCompleted(goto(stateH)) }

StateFsm
^^^^^^^^

``StateFsm`` allow to describe a state containing a nested state machine. When the nested state machine is done (exited), statments in ``whenCompleted { ... }`` are executed.

There is an example of StateFsm definition :

.. code-block:: scala

   // internalFsm is a function defined below
   val stateC = new StateFsm(fsm=internalFsm()) {
     whenCompleted {
       goto(stateD)
     }
   }

   def internalFsm() = new StateMachine {
     val counter = Reg(UInt(8 bits)) init (0)

     val stateA : State = new State with EntryPoint {
       whenIsActive {
         goto(stateB)
       }
     }

     val stateB : State = new State {
       onEntry (counter := 0)
       whenIsActive {
         when(counter === 4) {
           exit()
         }
         counter := counter + 1
       }
     }
   }

In the example above, ``exit()`` makes the state machine jump to the boot state (a internal hidden state). This notifies ``StateFsm`` about the completion of the inner state machine.

StateParallelFsm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``StateParallelFsm`` allows to handle multiple nested state machines. When all nested state machine are done, statments in ``whenCompleted { ... }`` are executed.

Example:

.. code-block:: scala

   val stateD = new StateParallelFsm (internalFsmA(), internalFsmB()) {
     whenCompleted{
       goto(stateE)
     }
   }

Notes about the entry state
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The way the entry state has been defined above makes it so that between the reset and the first clock sampling, the state machine is in a boot state. It is only after the first clock sampling that the defined entry state becomes active. This allows to properly enter the entry state (applying statements in ``onEntry``), and allows nested state machines.

While it is usefull, it is also possible to bypass that feature and directly having a state machine booting into a user state.

To do so, use `makeInstantEntry()` instead of defining a ``new State``. This function returns the boot state, active directly after reset.

.. note::
   The ``onEntry`` of that state will only be called when it transitions from another state to this state and not during boot.

.. note::
   During simulation, the boot state is always named ``BOOT``.

Example:

.. code-block:: scala

    // State sequance: IDLE, STATE_A, STATE_B, ...
    val fsm = new StateMachine {
      // IDLE is named BOOT in simulation
      val IDLE = makeInstantEntry()
      val STATE_A, STATE_B, STATE_C = new State
      
      IDLE.whenIsActive(goto(STATE_A))
      STATE_A.whenIsActive(goto(STATE_B))
      STATE_B.whenIsActive(goto(STATE_C))
      STATE_C.whenIsActive(goto(STATE_B))
    }

.. code-block:: scala

    //  State sequance : BOOT, IDLE, STATE_A, STATE_B, ...
    val fsm = new StateMachine {
      val IDLE, STATE_A, STATE_B, STATE_C = new State
      setEntry(IDLE)
      
      IDLE.whenIsActive(goto(STATE_A))
      STATE_A.whenIsActive(goto(STATE_B))
      STATE_B.whenIsActive(goto(STATE_C))
      STATE_C.whenIsActive(goto(STATE_B))
    }
